This is part of a project to investigate how advances in educational software may impact post secondary educational institutions. It is very much a work in progress at this time. 

The US department of education provides a list of eductional institutions. The code references a csv file called Accreditation_2012_03.csv. It downloaded from US Department of Education and it contains a database of accredited postsecondary institutions and programs in the US as of March 2012. It was downloaded with this URL http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/GetDownloadFile.aspx. 

The reaper subdirectory contains code which parses the csv and populates a Mongo database.
